#M8 Programming Assignment
Write a program that will display lines of a text you specify. 
It should take two arguments: **a file** or **a URL** and **the number of lines to display**. 
If the number of lines given is positive, it should display the first n lines of the text. 
If it is 0, it should display all the lines of the text. 
If it is a negative number, it should display the last n lines of the text. Your program should handle errors appropriately.
