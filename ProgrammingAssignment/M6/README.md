##M6-PA: Create a bowling score tracker collection

Design a data structure that will be used as elements in a collection. Each element should contain a unique name of the bowler and a list of scores and dates of the games they have played.

Then print to the screen each:

* Bowler name
* Number of games
* Average score of all of the games
* Score of their last game
* Date of their last game
* Provide test cases to prove your collection works.
