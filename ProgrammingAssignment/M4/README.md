#M4 Programming Assignment
Write a cash register class. It should have the following methods:


1. AddTransaction(amount) – add an amount to a running total and increments the number of transactions
2. TransactionCount( ) – returns the number of transactions received
3. Total( ) – returns the sum of the amounts of the transactions
4. ResetTransactions( ) – sets the total amount and transaction count to 0
4. Register Count( ) – returns the number of cash registers created

Next, write an application that instantiates at least two cash register objects to prove that your class works.
