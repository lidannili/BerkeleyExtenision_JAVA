#M2 Programming Assignment
Write a program that sorts Strings. The program should prompt the user for the number of Strings to read, and then read the Strings from standard input one at a time. Then it should sort the Strings into alphabetical order using any sorting algorithm with which you are familiar, and print them to the console. 

The commentary material on **console I/O**, **arrays**, and the **String.compareTo()** method should all be useful, so be sure to read the commentary! 

(Do not use any classes in the java.util package; specifically, do not use java.util.Arrays or java.util.Vector.)
