#M4 Programming Assignment
Write a cash register class. It should have the following methods:

1. AddTransaction(amount) – add an amount to a running total and increments the number of transactions
2. TransactionCount( ) – returns the number of transactions received
	consider it as count item
3. Total( ) – returns the sum of the amounts of the transactions
4. ResetTransactions( ) – sets the total amount and transaction count to 0
5. Register Count( ) – returns the number of cash registers created


Next, write an application that instantiates at least two cash register objects to prove that your class works.

P.S.: Don't worry about storing each individual transaction, and we are dealing only with totals. No need to handle individual orders/items per transaction.
